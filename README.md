# Keras-Flower-Image-Classification-model-with-Gradio

Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we will demonstrate how to easily build an image classification model using Keras and deploy it using Gradio.

**2) What is Gradio?**

Gradio is a machine learning library that transforms your trained machine learning model into an interactive application. Gradio provides simple user interfaces (UI) that enable users to interact with a trained machine learning model. It generates a web interface via which the user can test the trained model and view the prediction results. Gradio interacts directly with popular machine learning libraries such as Sckit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers.

**3) Which dataset has been used?**

The flower dataset from TensorFlow is used for image classification.

Details of this tutorial and model setup are discussed in my article https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/06/deploying-a-keras-flower-classification-model/ published on Analytics Vidhya.
